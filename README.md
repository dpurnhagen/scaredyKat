### Sketch for an Arduino robot for Mini Sumo Bot battling.
Based on [design and code](https://microservosumo.wordpress.com/) for an inexpesive autonomous robot, developed by James Dinsmore, Josh Pritt, and others, at the Melbourne Makerspace in Florida. This code is for the robot based on a 3D printed body, two FS90R continuous servo motors, controlled by an Arduino Nano.
